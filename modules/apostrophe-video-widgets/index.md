## Inherits from: [apostrophe-widgets](../apostrophe-widgets/index.html)
Provides the `apostrophe-video` widget, which displays videos, powered
by [apostrophe-video-field](../apostrophe-video-field/index.html) and
[apostrophe-oembed](../apostrophe-oembed/index.html). The video
widget accepts the URL of a video on any website that supports the
[oembed](http://oembed.com/) standard, including vimeo, YouTube, etc.
In some cases the results are refined by oembetter filters configured
by the `apostrophe-oembed` module. It is possible to configure new filters
for that module to handle video sites that don't natively support oembed.

Videos are not actually hosted or stored by Apostrophe.
