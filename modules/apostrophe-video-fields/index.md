## Inherits from: [apostrophe-module](../apostrophe-module/index.html)
### `apos.videoFields`
Implements the ["video" apostrophe schema field type](../../tutorials/getting-started/schema-guide.html).

The value of the field is an object with `url`, `title` and `thumbnail` properties, the latter
two being as obtained by `oembetter` at the time the URL was originally pasted and fetched
via the `oembed` protocol.

This field type is locked down to accept only URLs whose oembed response type
is `video`.

Videos are not actually hosted or stored by Apostrophe. They are displayed via
oembed-capable third party services like Vimeo and YouTube.
